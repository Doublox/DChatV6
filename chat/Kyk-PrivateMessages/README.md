***Commands***
- pm 'target id' 'message' [Example: pm 21 Hello my friend. This is an example.]
- r 'message' [Example: r Hey. This is reply example.]
- reply 'message' [Example: reply Hey. This is reply example.]
- pmStats

***Command Infos***
- /pm 'target id' 'msg' - This command will send the player with id of 'target id' a private message
- r 'message' - This command will reply to the last private message you got.
- reply 'message' - This command will reply to the last private message you got.
- pmStats - This command will allow people with permissions to see the defined statistics

***Ideas that i have been given privately***
- Give admins the ability to spy on the private messages (I really don't know if i am gonna add this feature but if you guys really want then sure)
- Add an easy switch so you could give everyone the permission to use statistics command.
